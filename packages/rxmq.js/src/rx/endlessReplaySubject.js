 * EndlessReplaySubject extension of ReplaySubject.

 * Subjects that do no close on multicasted stream completion and on multiple errors.
 * For documentation refer to
 * [ReplaySubject docs](@link https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/subjects/replaysubject.md).
 * The only difference is that EndlessReplaySubject never triggers '.complete()' and
 * does not closes observers on errors (thus allowing to continuously dispatch them).
